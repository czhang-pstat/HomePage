bio: |
    I'm Chao, currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Statistics & Applied Probability Dept. at UC Santa Barbara. My research interest is centered in functional/object-oriented data analysis, deep learning, and time series. The focus of my recent work is on modeling time-dependent probability density functions with the Wasserstein geometry. Successful applications include forecasting financial asset returns, human mortality distribution, etc. My work is under the supervision of Professor Alexander Petersen.
